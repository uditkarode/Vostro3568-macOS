# VostroMacEFI
This is a backup of a fully working EFI Partition made to work on the Dell Vostro 15-3568 Intel Core i3 Kaby Lake version.

## Issues:

√ Internal wifi card is not compatible. An external USB WiFi adapter should be detected.
√ Headphones might have static. To fix, let the laptop sleep once, then wake it. Codec Commander will do the rest.
√ HDMI video output does not work. Kernel panic makes the thing restart.
√ Trackpad sometimes does not work after a reboot.

Tested working on macOS Mojave 10.14.4!
